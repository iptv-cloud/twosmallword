# twosmallword

Given a list of words "L", and an integer "N", write a function that returns all
words from "L" that:
- are of length "N"
- are formed from two smaller words from "L"
Example: N=6, L=["hot", "bird", "dog", "tailor", "hotdog", "or", "if", "tail"]
Expected output --> ["tailor" (tail+or), "hotdog" (hot+dog)]
You may use Python, Java or Pseudocode to write the solution.
